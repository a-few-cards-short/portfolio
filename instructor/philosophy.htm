<p class="small"><i><u>Note:</u> This is written from a programming perspective, but is equally true from a graphic art perspective.</i></p>

<p class="small right"><em>And I can teach that too! &nbsp; :-)</em></p>

<h1>versatile programmers are handy</h1>

<p>Competence in other disciplines offers insight to novel solutions, simply because one has more tools at their disposal. <em>When all you have is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail.</em> Weaker, yet serviceable, programmers can produce very impressive work with good interdisciplinary skills. Exposure to other disciplines also allows a student to discover and hone their true strengths and passions.</p>

<p>Cross-discipline skills should be taught early on and cover fundamental principles so that the lessons learned can carry forward throughout the semesters of the programming concentration. Students learn by doing, and there will be plenty of opportunities to repeat and improve their interdisciplinary skills as they work on core programming projects.</p>

<p class="right"><em>Let's flex both sides of that wrinkly grey matter!</em></p>

<h1>programmers typically suck at art</h1>

<p>I'm not advocating developing a strong artistic skill set. Simple, aesthetically pleasing and intuitive design is governed by rules and guidelines; tapping into a programmer's existing methodology. Simple and effective techniques produce attainable, quality results.</p>

<p>Employers want experience; and much of that is based in understanding the bigger picture. Versatile programmers see things from multiple disciplinary perspectives. This forms a greater appreciation for the whole process, facilitating better communication with team members and even clients. This builds confidence.</p>

<p class="right"><em>I even saw a <b>versatile programmer</b>&trade; talk to a member of the opposite sex once. True story! They even made eye contact, I swear!</em></p>

<h1>so what am I preaching about?</h1>

<p>Cross-disciplinary programmer skills include:
<ul>
	<li>Documentation (concise, effective communication) and project planning</li>
	<li>Project management</li>
	<li>Visual design and layout (including typography)</li>
	<li>Vector/Bitmap graphics and animation</li>
	<li>3D modelling and animation</li>
	<li>Music composition and sound effects</li>
	<li>Moving out of your parents' basement <em>(worth the price of tuition itself!)</em></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>All these skills can be accomplished with high-quality, low learning-curve, free desktop applications <em>(which I'm familiar with)</em> that translate well to industry-level software. Also, learning different software packages (free vs. paid) for the same tasks encourages an appreciation for the task itself and not just specific software features. I encourage practicing these extra skills with every project, no matter how simple. Repetition is key.</p>

<p>Lesson delivery:
<ul>
	<li>Review previous lesson (and share student findings).</li>
	<li>Answer questions as a group.</li>
	<li>Explain the new lesson.</li>
	<li>Present the end result.</li>
	<li>Show the keys steps of the lesson.</li>
	<li>Answer questions one-on-one while students work to reproduce the lesson.</li>
	<li>Have an extra component for those who finish early.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p class="right"><em>Gotta keep those keeners engaged too!</em></p>

<p>Grading thoughts:</p>

<p>Essentially, if a student does the bare minimum (foundational lessons) to perfection, they get 75%. Programmers are problem solvers; they must show an aptitude for thinking outside the box.</p>

<p class="small"><i><u>Note:</u> There is a risk with being both competent and versatile. Students may find employers asking them to do too much (and them agreeing to it) because they're capable. <em>(Speaking from experience.)</em> However, students won't know their limits unless they push themselves. It's very important to recognize and communicate when the quality of one's work is suffering by being pulled in too many directions. That's why I promote an economical approach to performing cross-disciplinary skills.</i></p>

<p class="shout center"><em><span class="whisper">(TLDR)</span> Be versatile, but do more with less!</em></p>
